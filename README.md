# Post-Prompt Observability Viewer

A single-page application for visualizing SignalWire AI Agent post-conversation webhook payloads and SWML configuration files. Upload a JSON payload from a completed call and instantly see performance metrics, conversation flow, tool usage, latency analysis, and full call recordings with stereo waveform visualization. Also supports SWML inspection with interactive state diagrams and prompt analysis.

Built with **Vanilla JS**, **Vite**, **Chart.js**, **Mermaid**, and **wavesurfer.js** — no framework dependencies.

## 🆕 Agent Builder

The project now includes a **visual drag-and-drop agent builder** for creating SignalWire AI agents!

- **Location**: `/ui` directory
- **Dev Server**: `http://localhost:5177` (when running)
- **Features**: Visual canvas, step/function nodes, SWML export, Python SDK code generation

See [`ui/README.md`](ui/README.md) for full documentation.

## What This Does

When a SignalWire AI Agent call completes, the platform emits a `post_conversation` webhook payload containing everything that happened during the call: the full conversation log, SWAIG function calls, ASR confidence scores, token usage, latency measurements, and more.

This viewer parses that payload and presents it across nine interactive tabs:

| Tab | What It Shows |
|-----|---------------|
| **Dashboard** | 16 KPI metric cards — call duration, response latency, token usage, ASR confidence, barge-in rate, SWAIG call count, TPS stats |
| **Charts** | 6 Chart.js visualizations — response latency over time, tokens per second, ASR confidence distribution, message role breakdown, SWAIG execution latency, call timeline phases |
| **Timeline** | Horizontal swimlane showing the full call lifecycle — user speech, assistant responses, tool calls, thinking, manual says, all mapped to real timestamps |
| **Transcript** | Scrollable conversation with role-colored message bubbles, expandable metadata (latency, confidence, tool results), response time rating badges, and filters for finding slow responses |
| **SWAIG Inspector** | Accordion list of every SWAIG function call with full `post_data` and `post_response` as formatted JSON, search with auto-expand and field-level filtering |
| **Post-Prompt** | Tabbed view of raw, substituted, and parsed post-prompt data |
| **State Flow** | Interactive Mermaid diagram visualizing conversation flow as a state machine with scrollable viewport and PNG export |
| **Recording** | Stereo waveform visualization with call-log regions overlaid, synced video playback for MP4 recordings, playback controls with speed adjustment |
| **Global Data** | Expandable JSON view of `global_data`, `SWMLVars`, `SWMLCall`, and other top-level payload fields with search and field-level filtering |

Additionally, the viewer supports **SWML Inspector** mode for analyzing SignalWire Markup Language configuration files with four dedicated tabs:

| SWML Tab | What It Shows |
|----------|---------------|
| **Overview** | General configuration summary, sections, and high-level structure |
| **Prompts & Steps** | Interactive Mermaid state diagrams showing prompt flow with PNG export |
| **Functions** | Expandable list of all functions with parameters and metadata |
| **Configuration** | Raw JSON view of all SWML configuration options |

## Using the Library Standalone

The `lib/` directory has no DOM dependencies and can be imported independently in Node.js or other browser apps:

```js
import { parsePayload, computeMetrics } from './lib/index.js';

const raw = JSON.parse(jsonString);
const payload = parsePayload(raw);      // Validates, normalizes timestamps
const metrics = computeMetrics(payload); // Returns all derived metrics

console.log(metrics.duration.callDuration);    // seconds
console.log(metrics.latency.avgAnswerTime);    // ms
console.log(metrics.asr.avgConfidence);        // 0-1
console.log(metrics.conversation.turnCount);   // number
console.log(metrics.tools.swaigCallCount);     // number
console.log(metrics.tokens.totalInputTokens);  // number or null
```

### Metric Modules

| Module | Key Outputs |
|--------|-------------|
| `duration` | `callDuration`, `aiSessionDuration`, `ringTime` — handles `call_end_date=0` (in-progress calls) |
| `latency` | `avgAnswerTime`, `p95AnswerTime`, `minAnswerTime`, `maxAnswerTime`, per-response latency array |
| `asr` | `avgConfidence`, `bargeInRate`, `bargeInCount`, `totalUserMessages` |
| `conversation` | `turnCount`, `messagesByRole`, `totalWords`, `assistantWordCount`, `userWordCount` |
| `tools` | `swaigCallCount`, `avgExecutionLatency`, `toolBreakdown` (by function name), `actionTypes`, `toolCallRate` |
| `tokens` | `totalInputTokens`, `totalOutputTokens`, `avgTps`, `peakTps`, per-response TPS array |

## Payload Format

The viewer expects the standard SignalWire `post_conversation` webhook payload. Required fields:

```json
{
  "call_id": "uuid",
  "action": "post_conversation",
  "call_start_date": 1770000000000000,
  "call_log": [...]
}
```

Key optional sections that unlock additional features:

| Field | Unlocks |
|-------|---------|
| `call_log[].timestamp` | Timeline swimlane, transcript ordering |
| `call_log[].audio_latency` | Response latency metrics and charts |
| `call_log[].confidence` | ASR confidence stats and histogram |
| `call_log[].speaking_to_final_event` | User speech duration on timeline |
| `times[]` | Tokens per second chart, detailed latency analysis |
| `swaig_log[]` | SWAIG Inspector tab |
| `post_prompt_data` | Post-Prompt tab |
| `SWMLVars.record_call_url` | Recording tab with waveform + video |
| `total_input_tokens` / `total_output_tokens` | Token usage dashboard cards |
| `global_data` | Global Data tab |

## Edge Cases Handled

- **`call_end_date = 0`** — displayed as "In Progress," duration computed from `ai_end_date`
- **Missing token fields** — cards show "N/A," token charts are skipped
- **No `times[]` array** — TPS and detailed latency charts gracefully hidden
- **DTMF content in call_log** — displayed appropriately in transcript
- **Merged user messages** (`merge_count > 0`) — displayed as single messages per `call_log`
- **Barged assistant responses** — removed from `call_log` by the platform, handled cleanly
- **TPS int64 overflow** (from `token_time: 0`) — filtered out of stats
- **Consecutive assistant messages** (retries, garbled output) — timeline segments don't overlap
- **Tool timestamps** — correctly treated as call initiation time, not result time
- **Negative `speaking_to_turn_detection`** — common in production, handled without error
